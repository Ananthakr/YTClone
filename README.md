# YouTube Clone App

This project is initialized with React Native Cli. It uses

- React Native
- React Navigation
- React Native Webview
- Magic.link SDK


## Notes

- Folders are splitted based on their utility for ex. common components are grouped in /components, /screens are grouped in screens and so on.
- Although React Navigation is not much needed here, used it as neat basic setup for the project.
- Style Tokens are grouped in /styles.
- Due to SDK restrictions, login persistance after killing app is unavailable.
